1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:03,025
This is what the freedom
to assemble looks like!

2
00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:04,260
Stop silencing the press!

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,762
Stop persecuting the opposition!

4
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:10,224
Stop imprisoning people
simply because they're gay!

5
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,143
You're destroying Russia's future!

6
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,061
When Petrov's motorcade arrives,

7
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,272
have the band already playing
as loud as they can.

8
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:17,440
I'll speak to the colonel.

9
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:19,608
- What about the Pussy Riot girls?
- I briefed them myself.

10
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,986
Here's a list of the issues
they want you to discuss with Petrov.

11
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,321
- We're good to go.
- Tell them I did.

12
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,239
Sure it's a good idea
to have them at the dinner?

13
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:26,782
It's a smart idea.
They're dissidents.

14
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,617
They've been nothing but a pain
in Petrov's ass.

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,493
He wants to co-opt them
with a photo? Fine.

16
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,413
If it's important to him,
it's important to me.

17
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,165
- Bob.
- Mr. President.

18
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,334
We have to get these amendments
out of committee.

19
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,002
Get AmWorks on the floor.

20
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,463
We might be able to squeeze
a couple through, but not all seven.

21
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:41,839
Then restructure the funding.

22
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:43,674
Shoot for one amendment
in one committee.

23
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:44,925
Try Ways and Means.

24
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,927
The Republicans
will never go for a lump sum.

25
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:49,138
We have to split it up
into jurisdictional parts.

26
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,433
When I announced America Works,
I promised ten million jobs.

27
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:54,768
- Maybe it's time to lower expectations.
- No, look--

28
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,896
Pardon me, sir.
President Petrov's motorcade is 15 out.

29
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,440
- Thank you.
- I'll let you go.

30
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,525
Bob, we have a few more minutes.
Please sit down.

31
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:02,985
You have a lot on your plate today.

32
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:05,154
Why don't we pick it up tonight
at the state dinner?

33
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:07,198
Looking forward to it, Mr. President.

34
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,870
What is the face of a coward?

35
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:15,122
The back of his head
as he runs from the battle.

36
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:19,377
[sirens wailing]

37
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,591
[brass band playing]

38
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:32,390
[protesters chanting]

39
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:41,148
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

40
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:43,234
This is your first visit
to the White House?

41
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,695
Yes, yes.
But my third president.

42
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:51,409
[protesters continue chanting]

43
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:57,581
I have reviewed your proposal
for the Jordan Valley.

44
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,876
Impressive.

45
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,506
So you liked the proposal?

46
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,342
- The answer is no.
- [laughs]

47
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,302
It's not a joke, Mr. President.

48
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:14,973
I have no interest whatsoever
in pursuing your plan.

49
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,526
[theme music playing]

DDLV resync by CookiesMonsta

51
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:01,997
[woman] The Jordan Valley
is the trees instead of the forest.

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,584
And this bilateral approach,
it's... alienating.

53
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:08,629
I don't often see eye to eye
with Ms. Caspi,

54
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:12,424
but it does feel like
you're asking the state of Palestine

55
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,886
to support a plan without
having a seat at the table.

56
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,763
Well, our goal is to soften Russia,

57
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:20,974
to bring them in as a partner first--

58
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:24,478
If we can get the Russians
to agree to a joint force,

59
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,772
monitor the valley together,
then they're invested.

60
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:29,983
They won't be a thorn in our side
when we move forward--

61
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,319
How can we count on the Russians?

62
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,573
Does your husband truly
believe he can trust Petrov?

63
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,617
The president is optimistic.

64
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,994
All we ask is that you
remain open-minded.

65
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:45,541
I hope you'll convey our dissatisfaction
directly to your husband.

66
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,543
I'll be sure to share your concerns.

67
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:51,296
Ambassador Underwood
will remain in contact with both of you.

68
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:04,435
I shouldn't have
interrupted you earlier.

69
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:06,562
In the meeting.
It was out of place,

70
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,855
and I should have let you
do all the talking.

71
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,441
It's fine.

72
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,737
I know you have doubts about me.

73
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,281
The recess appointment.
We haven't discussed it.

74
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,367
- And we should.
- It really isn't necessary.

75
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:24,329
It is an unorthodox dynamic, yes.
You will always be the First Lady.

76
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,332
This is your plane, after all.
But we can work around that.

77
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,417
Yes, I know,

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,210
- but I want you to know that--
- [knock at door]

79
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:32,212
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is on the line.

80
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:44,266
- Hi.
- [Frank] Hey. How'd it go?

81
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,518
- Should we conference Cathy in?
- No, just tell me.

82
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,270
A lot of pushback. They aren't happy.

83
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,481
Well, they'll get on board
when the time comes.

84
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,775
- What about you?
- He said no.

85
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,486
- First word out of his mouth.
- No to everything?

86
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,405
Oh, he might just be playing mind
games, trying to throw me off balance,

87
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,949
but this is a guy who was brought up
through the KGB, after all.

88
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,410
We're gonna have to have you
and Cathy use the light touch.

89
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:05,996
- We need to massage this.
- Let's include her in this phone call.

90
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,623
No, just tell her.
I have to go in soon.

91
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:10,167
It's important we don't bypass her.

92
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,670
If it looks like we're
leaving her out of the loop, Francis...

93
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,004
[sighs] All right, put her on.

94
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,214
[man] I can't tell you how much
it would mean to the team.

95
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,967
To have your qualifications,
your expertise on board.

96
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,011
Even just having your name
on the website.

97
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,138
I appreciate your saying that,
Congressman.

98
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,890
Brad. Please.
Congressman's what the interns call me.

99
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:27,643
All right. Brad it is.

100
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:30,771
Now as for your title,
I was thinking Special Advisor?

101
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,398
- Title doesn't matter to me.
- You pick what you want.

102
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,858
And you make your own hours.
Come and go as you like.

103
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,237
Uh, compensation,
would 220 a year work for you?

104
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:42,282
The cap is 173.

105
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,993
Well, the extra 50K
would come out of my re-election fund.

106
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:47,120
I mean, you deserve more than the cap.

107
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,374
- That's a very generous offer.
- Well, I expect you to earn it.

108
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:53,377
[laughs] I really want
to make my mark this session.

109
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,421
- That's more than Underwood paid me.
- I'm sorry?

110
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:59,216
When I was his chief of staff,
I made the cap.

111
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,759
He never came anywhere near 220.

112
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,427
Well, like I said, I think you deserve--

113
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,638
It's too much money, Congressman.

114
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,097
Well, I disagree, but,

115
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,183
hey, I'm not gonna argue
if you want to get paid less.

116
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:11,061
As I was saying, this transpo bill,

117
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,355
we really have an opportunity
to make a difference.

118
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:16,525
[camera shutters clicking]

119
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:24,115
Ladies and gentlemen,
the session is over.

120
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,951
Please, right this way.
Thank you for coming.

121
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,836
I hear you've recently taken up surfing.

122
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,548
We have a few spots on the Black Sea.

123
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,717
It's mostly so I can pose
for the photos.

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,468
Yes, I've seen them.

125
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,098
It plays well with the young people.

126
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,308
It's important they see
their president has some fun,

127
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,018
doesn't take himself too seriously.

128
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,189
I have a gift for you.

129
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,113
I'm sorry for the delay.

130
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:05,365
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

131
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:09,745
Shall we?

132
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:14,458
This was handmade by Tomas Vu,
a very talented American artist.

133
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,087
He laser-etches images on one side,
and on the other side...

134
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,716
- he puts Beatles lyrics.
- Uh-huh. [laughs]

135
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,551
Hm. Back in the USSR.

136
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,011
It's a museum piece,
but you can still ride it.

137
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,890
You should come out
to my dacha in Sochi sometime.

138
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,433
We'll surf together.

139
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:35,562
The water is cold as hell, but...
the women are very warm.

140
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:37,981
Oh, I'm not sure what Claire
would think about that.

141
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,943
Well, bring her along.

142
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,820
It's crawling with artists out there.

143
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,446
She might find something she likes.

144
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,493
Mr. President, I'm intrigued.

145
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,496
The first thing you say to me
is "no" the second you arrive,

146
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,248
and the next moment
you're inviting me to your dacha.

147
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,875
Who am I dealing with?

148
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,086
I believe I was clear when we first met.
What confuses you?

149
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,464
Our delegations have been discussing
these issues for months.

150
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:05,801
Yes, but discussions
are not the same as commitment.

151
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:08,428
And, uh, I'm telling you now.

152
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,639
There will be no commitment.

153
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,808
You could've told me that on the phone.

154
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:18,605
I assumed you were undoing
an insult by having me here.

155
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,106
What insult is that?

156
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,234
Two of your predecessors
never invited me to Washington.

157
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,445
This summit is not just for show.

158
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,114
I want to make meaningful strides
toward peace.

159
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,951
The Middle East is hopeless.
History tells us that.

160
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,704
I'm offering you
the chance to make history.

161
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,830
I'll be honest with you,

162
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,541
because you've been kind enough
to invite me to your country.

163
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,170
Russia has nothing to gain
from peace in the Middle East.

164
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:46,675
And more importantly, nothing
to gain from working with America.

165
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,637
Israel has always distrusted us.

166
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:54,057
- You expect that to change?
- We expect to build trust over time.

167
00:09:56,518 --> 00:10:00,355
How was your meeting
with the ambassadors this morning?

168
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:03,191
Ambassador Aruri called me.

169
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:06,611
They have their doubts, but we
encouraged them to keep an open mind.

170
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,279
He described it as grave concerns.

171
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,114
They will acclimate
as soon as we establish--

172
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:13,284
Has your husband made direct overtures
to Israel and Palestine?

173
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:17,664
All formal communication has been
handled through the State Department.

174
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:19,958
But your husband can't possibly
believe they'll comply.

175
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,668
Gentlemen,
for the purposes of these talks,

176
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:25,129
I'd appreciate it if you refer to him
as the president, not as my husband.

177
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,882
Of course, Madam Ambassador.

178
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,092
And you really should be addressing
Secretary Durant.

179
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,762
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.

180
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:36,433
Our apologies, Madam Secretary.
Please, continue.

181
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:41,772
We'd like to finish reviewing
the specifics, so page 12, please.

182
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,025
Mr. President, we're already
working together on several fronts:

183
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:48,319
nonproliferation,
the War on Terror, North Korea.

184
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:51,073
I don't see any reason that
the Middle East should be any different.

185
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,408
- Because it's an American plan.
- It's not an American plan.

186
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,660
- I'm promising equal terms.
- Oh, promises.

187
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,496
Carter promised equal involvement,
then shut us out of Camp David.

188
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,165
- Clinton did the same with Bosnia.
- I'm the president now.

189
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:02,459
That won't happen this time.

190
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,670
Until 18 months from now,
when you are replaced.

191
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,592
I'm jealous, Viktor.

192
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:15,263
You don't answer to anyone.
You have no real opposition.

193
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,266
You know exactly how
every election is gonna turn out.

194
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,603
Well, it's not like that
in the United States.

195
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:27,567
I'm not running because I can do things
a candidate can't do, like this proposal.

196
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,153
Please, Mr. President,
we both know you'll run.

197
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:34,825
Now, whether you win...
Who knows?

198
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:38,495
Brass tacks. If you could have anything,
what would it be?

199
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,791
I came with nothing to ask.

200
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:47,378
Men like you don't show up for dinner
without an appetite.

201
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,803
It was a long flight, Mr. President.

202
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,681
How about we stop here for now.

203
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:01,518
I rest my eyes a bit and put some
thought into this with a fresh mind.

204
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,229
Maybe I'll...
think of something I want.

205
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:10,527
- We'll talk more later, at dinner.
- Of course, if that's what you prefer.

206
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:15,657
He knows exactly what he wants,
but he needs to be wooed.

207
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,992
Progress, nonetheless.

208
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:20,537
You can't turn a "no" to a "yes"
without a "maybe" in between.

209
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,007
[man] Gentlemen...

210
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,384
Deputy Director coming through.

211
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:13,464
[man] Orsay? Come with me, please.

212
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,134
[Green] We got Asher.

213
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,887
Two-thirty this morning.
He was scared to death.

214
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,848
By 2:45, he gave us six terabytes
of compressed files.

215
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:24,142
All 25 million AT&T users.

216
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,852
You hid your goodies
with the wrong person.

217
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,064
- He wasn't the only one.
- I think he was.

218
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,942
You can't arrest me for charges
that have already been dropped.

219
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,777
Relax. No one's arresting you.

220
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:39,074
From the reports I've been getting,
you've been doing an excellent job for us.

221
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,284
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.

222
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,995
Bigger assignments.
Manage your own team.

223
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,705
You know I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

224
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:47,958
But you do have a choice.

225
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,086
You can make the most
of this second chance if you want to,

226
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:55,090
but... you have to prove you want it.

227
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,802
- Names.
- That's all I've ever wanted.

228
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:01,805
No.

229
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,144
Asher's going to give up names.

230
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:11,231
- He wouldn't do that.
- He might.

231
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:14,985
Let's hope none of them tell us about
anything we didn't charge you for.

232
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:20,782
You have a future here, Gavin.

233
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,536
All right. Back to it.

234
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,500
Keep up the good work.

235
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,586
We have to wine and dine.

236
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,380
- Charm them senseless.
- Them? Who's the other?

237
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,717
Birch. He's sitting on AmWorks
like his ass is afraid of the sun.

238
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,886
Please don't make me talk to Bob.

239
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,681
You just focus on Petrov.
I'll deal with Bob.

240
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,850
Excuse me, sir. We're all set.

241
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,768
President Petrov is in the Yellow Oval.

242
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,394
Thank you, Calista.

243
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:56,109
I think I may need to do
some damage control with Cathy.

244
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,736
- Why?
- I've been trying to be deferential,

245
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,323
but I think it's coming off
as patronizing.

246
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,450
- Well, that was the risk.
- I know.

247
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:06,494
Is she feeling threatened?

248
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:09,622
Threatened, no.
Possibly overshadowed.

249
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:13,126
I think I'm getting too much attention
and it's tough to be effective

250
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,296
when I don't have Cathy on my team,
so I may need to win her over.

251
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,132
Well, let's not forget
where the focus is tonight.

252
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:22,260
Since when can't I do
two things at once?

253
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,470
- You're crooked.
- What?

254
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:30,268
- Ready for battle.
- Yes.

255
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,979
[classical piano music playing]

256
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:10,016
The Vice President of the United States,
Donald Blythe.

257
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,102
- Mr. President. Welcome.
- Mr. Vice President.

258
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,645
- Thank you.
- [camera shutters clicking]

259
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,356
President Petrov, welcome.

260
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:19,109
- It's a pleasure.
- [camera shutters clicking]

261
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,985
Hi. You look beautiful.

262
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,820
Oh, it's serviceable.

263
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:25,407
- You look fantastic, as always.
- Thank you.

264
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:28,952
All eyes at the table
will be on you, not them.

265
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,415
Senator Mendoza.
Soon to be candidate Mendoza.

266
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:37,001
- The rumor mill begins.
- You started with Reagan, no?

267
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,795
Staffed on his '84 campaign.

268
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:41,881
He has a portrait of the Gipper
in his office wearing a cowboy hat.

269
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:45,468
- Hm. When men were men. Hm?
- [laughs]

270
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:49,806
[camera shutters clicking]

271
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,725
Bob, I had a thought. Dave Blanchek
is on Armed Services and--

272
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,519
I don't want to hold up the line.

273
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,064
- Mr. President, a pleasure.
- I want to move Birch.

274
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,857
Put Mendoza next to me instead.

275
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:02,902
Alan. You clean up well.

276
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,570
Class by association.

277
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,406
- Where's your date?
- I don't have one.

278
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:10,118
- I can walk you in too, if you'd like.
- No. Wouldn't want to ruin the picture.

279
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,202
[camera shutters clicking]

280
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,871
Ah, our special guests.

281
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,665
I'm so delighted
you could be with us.

282
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,875
Thank you so much for coming.
Mr. President.

283
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,837
[speaking Russian] It's taken us too long
to sit at the same table.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,175
Did you discuss
our issues in the closed talks?

285
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:26,592
We discussed many things.

286
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,720
But specifically our concerns?

287
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:32,140
[speaking English]
Was anything on our list discussed?

288
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:34,892
- Why don't we take a photo first?
- [Petrov] Good idea. Hm?

289
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:38,562
[camera shutters clicking]

290
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:57,374
Viktor, tell me. Are you in love?

291
00:17:57,457 --> 00:18:01,294
I don't know about...
love, but...

292
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:05,882
I'm learning to enjoy being divorced.

293
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,759
[glass clinking]

294
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:12,805
[speaks Russian]

295
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,141
[speaking English]
Which translates into:

296
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,768
"Howdy, and please
don't steal the silverware."

297
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:20,397
- [laughter]
- [Frank laughs]

298
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,483
Now that I have exhausted
all of the Russian I know,

299
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:27,153
Claire and I would like to welcome
all of you to the White House,

300
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:32,409
as we host President Petrov
in this historic state visit.

301
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:35,828
A century ago, a century and a half ago,

302
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:40,917
de Tocqueville wrote, in regards
to America and Russia, the following:

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,795
"Their point of departure
and their paths diverse,

304
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:47,882
nevertheless, each seems called

305
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:51,802
by some secret desire of Providence,

306
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:57,225
to one day hold in their hands
the destinies of half the world."

307
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,978
Well, I'd like to amend that tonight
and say, not just half the world,

308
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:05,483
the entire world looks to us
for leadership.

309
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:10,154
So, to President Petrov,
and all of the great things

310
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,615
that our great nations
will do together.

311
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,368
- Mr. President.
- [all] Hear, hear!

312
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,287
[glasses clinking]

313
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,208
[speaks Russian]

314
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,295
[speaking English] Which is Russian for,
"Never trust the French."

315
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:27,630
[laughter]

316
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,759
And thank you to the president and First
Lady for your grace and hospitality.

317
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,554
Now, a little more recently
than de Tocqueville,

318
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:37,348
about, uh, 30 years ago,

319
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:39,976
Mikhail Gorbachev came
to this very house

320
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,646
and talked of an end
to our "winter of discontent."

321
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:50,027
I think it's safe to say that
that winter seems far gone now.

322
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:55,283
And here, on this beautiful May evening,
I welcome a "spring of enchantment."

323
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:59,954
Now we all know which of you
brings the enchantment to the table.

324
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:02,332
To you, Mrs. Underwood.

325
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:09,380
- And, of course, your lesser half.
- Ah, thank you.

326
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,257
[scattered laughter]

327
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:17,639
Now I'd like to toast three others
in this room tonight.

328
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:21,601
Nadya Tolokonnikova,
Masha Alyokhina,

329
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:23,561
and Pyotr Verzilov.

330
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,272
Now, I know we had our differences.

331
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:30,193
But I also know they come
from something we all share:

332
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:34,364
a deep love of our country.

333
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,118
To you. And to Russia.

334
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:40,244
[all toast in Russian]

335
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:43,956
Mr. President, Nadya and Masha
would like to make a toast.

336
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,376
[Nadya speaking Russian]

337
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,424
[speaking English] To Viktor Petrov,
whose loyalty runs so deep

338
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:55,301
he's given his friends
half of the country.

339
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,053
[speaking Russian]

340
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,431
[Pyotr] Who's so open to criticism,
that most of his critics are in prison.

341
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,099
[Nadya speaking Russian]

342
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,689
[speaking Russian]

343
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,692
You made your point.

344
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:16,531
Now, please, sit and let us all

345
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:20,243
drink and laugh,
like true Russians do. Hm?

346
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,539
[glass shatters]

347
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,798
[Petrov] Well, Mr. President,

348
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:39,011
this is proof why you made the
right decision never to have children.

349
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,598
[laughter]

350
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:45,268
[applause]

351
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,938
My staff prepped them.

352
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:51,441
- They assured us.
- It's nothing.

353
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:55,027
- I admire your grace.
- Please. Not another word.

354
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:59,240
[Seth] I knew Pussy Riot was a bad idea.

355
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:02,243
- [Doug] You should go.
- No. Best thing is not to comment.

356
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,370
It lowers us to their level.

357
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,123
Juice or soda?

358
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,874
Diet something, if you got it.

359
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:11,961
Who are they?

360
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:16,882
My brother's kids.

361
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:19,510
Adorable.

362
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,262
[opens can]

363
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:30,020
- I got a job offer.
- Yeah? Where?

364
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:33,023
Brad Petite. Special Advisor.

365
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:35,735
From Hawaii.

366
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,570
- Junior congressman?
- That's right.

367
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:40,698
I like him. He's a good guy.
He's ambitious.

368
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:42,908
He offered me a lot of money.

369
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,495
- Yeah?
- Two-twenty.

370
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,413
Jesus.

371
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:51,167
That's more than I would ever make
at the White House.

372
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:57,715
- You arrange the job?
- No.

373
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,509
Did the president?

374
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:02,094
- What are you talking about?
- Don't bullshit me, Seth.

375
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:03,845
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

376
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,058
Who's the senior congressman
from Hawaii?

377
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,021
- [sighs]
- Chair of Appropriations.

378
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,231
I know him,
I'm just drawing a blank right now.

379
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:17,694
It's not him, it's a her.

380
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:20,780
Francine Tenaka.
And if you don't know who Tenaka is,

381
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:23,115
there's no reason you should know
who Brad Petite is,

382
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,827
or that he's ambitious or a good guy.

383
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,330
This job offer came from you
or the president.

384
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,624
And I'm telling you that it didn't.

385
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,670
Well, I'm turning it down.

386
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:40,090
You tell the president that I'm ready
to come back whenever he needs me.

387
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,259
I don't need training wheels.

388
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:48,391
[classical piano music playing]

389
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,693
I need you to work on Birch
while you're here.

390
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:01,487
See if you can get that list
of possible candidates.

391
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,781
I don't think putting him down
the far end of the table's

392
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:05,032
put him in a very chatty mood.

393
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,369
[woman speaking indistinctly
with Russian accent]

394
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:11,664
Refrigeration.
Are you talking about refrigeration?

395
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:14,083
- No.
- Re-bridge nations.

396
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,294
We need to re-bridgenate ourselves
so we'll more trust each other.

397
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,004
Da? Yes.

398
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:21,382
[Frank] Let's get these amendments
out of committee.

399
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:22,842
Not all of them, just some of them.

400
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,344
The Speaker would go ballistic
if I started meddling in the House.

401
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,889
Not if it means he's going to battle
with the presumptive nominee.

402
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:29,557
He knows where his bread is buttered.

403
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,685
You shove your wife's recess appointment
down my throat, now you want my help?

404
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,061
I had to fill the post.

405
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:36,689
And you have a city
full of career diplomats.

406
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,649
Her appointment was
a slap in the Senate's face.

407
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,902
Let's not get hung up
on appointments, all right?

408
00:24:40,984 --> 00:24:43,153
Hector, whatever
you want me to sign, I'll sign.

409
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:45,281
I will not hold a veto over your head.

410
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:49,368
You can veto whatever you want.
Just helps our case in 2016.

411
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,245
Excuse me.

412
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:00,254
Which is more intoxicating,
this wine or Claire Underwood?

413
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:02,465
[chuckles]

414
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:03,925
How often do you use that line?

415
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:07,136
- Not as often as you use yours.
- Which line is that?

416
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:10,264
"Viktor, are you in love?"

417
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:16,687
President Descoteaux told me you asked
him the same thing when he was here.

418
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,318
I believe my husband quoted a Russian
author the night he gave that toast.

419
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,321
- Don't say, uh... Tolstoy?
- Pushkin.

420
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:30,200
"A deception that elevates us
is dearer than a host of low truths."

421
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:33,579
Ah... He didn't make that toast.

422
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:37,959
- No, he didn't.
- No, no. [chuckles]

423
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,127
Tell me, do you
actually know your Pushkin,

424
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,880
or did you just study up
before I arrived?

425
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,090
Does it really matter?

426
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:50,930
So, this is what he does?

427
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:53,014
He leaves the seduction to you.

428
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:56,686
Isn't there a...
a word for that in English? Um...

429
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,147
- For what?
- "Pimping," yes?

430
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,107
He's pimping you out.

431
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,736
How charming you are.

432
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,571
Thank you.

433
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,700
And you make a much better First Lady
than ambassador,

434
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:12,827
from what my people tell me.

435
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:16,956
Only teasing.

436
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:21,627
More wine... for the ambassador.

437
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,170
Please.

440
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,770
[Petrov] Ah! [clears throat]

441
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:43,232
Mr. President, my gift for you.

442
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,235
Best vodka in the world.

443

Osobaya Sayanskaya.

444
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,699
Solid gold.

445
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:54,660
Each one of these bottles is 750,000.

446
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,539
Now, a toast.

447
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:05,546
To friendship, to good food,

448
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:10,551
and to Leo Tolstoy, who said,

449
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:13,763
"If you want to be happy, be."

450
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:16,306
- [soft laughter]
- Drink!

451
00:27:21,437 --> 00:27:22,438
Ah!

452
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,566
Now... you sniff your bread.

[all] Nu!

456

- Then whistle.
- [all whistle]

457
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:36,493
Sniff your sleeve.

- And... eat your pickle.

Now, why we do all this?

461
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,631
- No one knows.
- [laughter]

- Again!
- [laughter]

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,384
- Oh, no. Now, Mr. President.
- Mm, mm!

Now, you, Mr. Vice President.

- A toast!
- Oh! Uh... Um...

Um... You have a C for me?

507
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,737
- [plays note]
- [hums]

508
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,617
[singing in Russian]

509
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,343
You offered vetoes for sale to Mendoza?

510
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,304
Bob, shh... the president's singing.

511
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,139
Is that why you sat him next to you?

512
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:28,184
Bob, as you said,
the Republicans control Congress.

513
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:32,813
[singing, clapping continues]

514
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:36,775
Any luck with Birch?

515
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:40,487
No list yet.
I'll keep working him.

516
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,739
Where's Dr. Cooke?

517
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,783
He got called away to surgery.

518
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:50,413
Save it for Svetla.

519
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:51,915
That's not her name.

520
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,251
- She looks like a Svetla.
- [laughs]

521
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:26,033
[music, clapping stops]

522
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:30,829
- [applause]
- [Petrov] Hey!

523
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:34,875
Well, I don't think we can end
the evening on a higher note,

524
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,919
so I want to thank you all for coming,

525
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,005
for the singing
and the dancing and the vodka.

526
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:42,049
But most especially to my friend,
Peter Cincotti.

527
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:43,133
- Thank you.
- [applause]

528
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:45,010
Coming all the way here
to the White House.

529
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:48,097
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

530
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,058
Wonderful.
And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.

531
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,351
Thank you. Thank you.

532
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:56,188
Your motorcade is ready, Mr. President.

533
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:57,398
I'll walk you out.

534
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,775
But first, I want to show you something.
Come with me.

535
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,777
- We'll be right down, Calista.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,615
[Doug] What if I get you transferred?
To some other agency.

537
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:08,867
[Gavin] It doesn't matter
who I work for. He'll find a way.

538
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:13,580
[Gavin sighs]

539
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:15,665
How much do you care about staying here?

540
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,542
- What, DC?
- In this country.

541
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:21,755
I'd have been long gone if they didn't
put a travel lock on my passport.

542
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:23,590
[Doug] So let's unlock it.

543
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:28,720
Is that something you can do?
If I get you what you want?

544
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,349
I need to know exactly where she is.

545
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:35,852
Not a state. Not a city.
An address.

546
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:40,065
If I use the Bureau's software and
get caught, I'll give them your name.

547
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,984
I understand.

548
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,783
All right.

549
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:52,869
Tell me everything you know about her.

550
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:55,372
Good night.

551
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,086
- How about a night cap?
- Oh, it's late.

552
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,797
And I haven't had that much vodka
since college.

553
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,257
Tulane, right?

554
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,468
So they tell me.
It's all a bit of a blur.

555
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,970
What did you drink in school?
Hurricanes?

556
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:13,307
Oh, we weren't barbarians.
Scotch, no ice.

557
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,435
Oh... Two Chivas, neat.

558
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:21,982
Cubans. Smuggled in.

559
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:24,151
I thought you might
appreciate the irony.

560
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,069
Ah. I do.

561
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:27,404
[sniffs]

562
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,869
Ah. And where does this lead?

563
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:35,454
Basement entrance.

564
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,956
The Nixon kids would
bring their dates up this way.

565
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,293
Kennedy probably used it
for similar reasons.

566
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:43,379
Well, you know, now that I'm divorced,

567
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:46,215
I don't have to sneak anyone
in and out of the palace.

568
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:49,176
They can come through the front door.
With some dignity.

569
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:52,471
Well, dignity's a bit overrated
for a mistress, don't you think?

570
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,682
[laughs]

571
00:34:55,765 --> 00:35:00,854
Ah... you know,
a woman like your wife, for example,

572
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:04,233
would certainly make it worthwhile.

573
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:06,985
Do you kiss the wife
of every president you meet?

574
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:10,406
Oh. Not every president's wife
looks like yours.

575
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,573
[laughs]

576
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:14,617
I'd push him down the stairs
and light his broken body on fire

577
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:18,580
just to watch it burn,
if it wouldn't start a world war.

578
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,749
- May I?
- Of course.

579
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:25,462
[laughing]

580
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:27,589
Well, do you think
they'll ever come around?

581
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:29,466
Oh, I don't know.

582
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,052
There'll be more summits,
a hundred CoDels.

583
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:36,348
They'll ping-pong back and forth
for months before Petrov shows his hand.

584
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:40,102
[Cathy laughs]

585
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,604
- What?
- Nothing.

586
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,022
Tell me.

587
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:47,359
I was just picturing Bugakov
playing ping-pong.

588
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:51,280
- Bugayev?
- [both laugh]

589
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:53,656
Imagine him playing beer pong.

590
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,285
Then these negotiations would be over.

591
00:35:56,368 --> 00:36:00,163
You are looking at the Delta Phi
beer pong champion.

592
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:01,706
- No.
- Yes.

593
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,792
Both sophomore and junior years.

594
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,419
And what happened senior year?

595
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:07,712
Well, I had to start studying
for law school.

596
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,672
[both laugh]

597
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:13,343
Well, I wasn't... a champion.

598
00:36:13,427 --> 00:36:15,678
- I wasn't too bad, though.
- You?

599
00:36:15,762 --> 00:36:18,390
- Mm-hm.
- [both laugh]

600
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,517
- I think we should play.
- What?

601
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:21,726
Oh, you can't be serious.

602
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,771
Excuse me? Can you ask housekeeping
to bring us some ping-pong balls, please?

603
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:27,190
I have got to go home.

604
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:29,401
We'll be playing by Harvard rules.

605
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:36,992
You have to admire their fearlessness.

606
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:41,330
None of them understand, do they?

607
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:44,040
What it takes to govern.

608
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:46,585
They scream and yell
and stomp their feet,

609
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:49,296
but if they had to spend
just one day in our shoes,

610
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:52,174
the weight we carry on our shoulders...

611
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,844
Like, um... the Middle East?

612
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,765
Oh, I know why we're here,
smoking our cigars.

613
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,189
- And?
- You're not going to like it.

614
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:12,944
Yes! Ha-ha!

615
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:14,821
Drink up.

616
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:21,161
Okay. For the Crimson.

617
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:28,627
- Damn!
- [laughs]

618
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:32,088
[exhales]

619
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:34,132
[blows]

620
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:39,054
Yes! I still got it. [laughs]

621
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:44,643
You don't have to drink that.

622
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,102
I accept your mercy.

623
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:47,187
[laughs]

624
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,692
And I am going to leave
before you challenge me to a rematch.

625
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:54,736
You're not even gonna give me a shot
at winning in my own house?

626
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:57,614
First rule of diplomacy:
stop while you're ahead,

627
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:01,702
which is what I should've done,
after that third vodka of Petrov's.

628
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:05,455
What do you think of him?

629
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,418
Petrov? I don't know.

630
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:12,754
You were the one
who talked to him all night.

631
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,590
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.

632
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:17,175
So, not a fan?

633
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:20,470
I think he's very intelligent.
And he has a charm.

634
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:23,056
That kiss was... too much.

635
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,475
No, that's just pushing buttons.

636
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:28,645
The Russians love to do that.

637
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:30,355
Good night.

638
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:34,401
I don't think he's to be trusted, Cathy.

639
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:37,654
Especially after tonight.
And it made me think...

640
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,491
Go on.

641
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:45,245
It made me wonder about Francis' plan.

642
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:49,791
I'm not sure that it's a good idea
to be partnered with Petrov.

643
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:53,629
In the meantime,
we alienate Israel and Palestine.

644
00:38:56,298 --> 00:39:00,761
Well... between you and me, I agree.

645
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,765
Sit with me.

646
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,892
What would you do differently?

647
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:11,854
Well...

648
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,401
If the goal is to get troops
into the Jordan Valley,

649
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:20,196
well, then there's more than one way
to skin that cat.

650
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,282
A multinational force?

651
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:25,118
I would go through the UN.

652
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,203
Peacekeeping?

653
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:29,247
You wouldn't get past Russia's veto.

654
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:33,794
There might be a way, but...

655
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:37,964
you'd have a lot of responsibility
on your shoulders.

656
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,384
Well, if you can give me guidance,
I'm sure I can handle it.

657
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:47,599
There is precedent
with the Uniting for Peace Resolution.

658
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:50,811
We used it to get around
the Russians for the Korean War.

659
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:59,110
- The whole thing?
- From Poland to the UK.

660
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:01,488
I want the entire
missile defense system gone.

661
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:04,491
You know that's there to defend
against North Korea, against Iran.

662
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,368
And far closer
to my borders than theirs.

663
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:09,162
I'm asking for a few thousand troops
in the Jordan Valley.

664
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:11,289
You're asking me to dismantle
Europe's defense system.

665
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:13,834
What you're really asking for
is American forces

666
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,585
just south of the Caucasus.

667
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:18,004
You must have a strategic play in mind.

668
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,131
This is about stability in the region.

669
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:23,510
You're trying to consolidate
your foothold in the region. Hm?

670
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:27,263
The Black Sea, Kazakhstan,
Chechnya, Crimea.

671
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:31,100
So, please...
don't insult me with peace.

672
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,234
Whatever your strategic goals may be,
the missile defense system is mine.

673
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:44,656
Viktor, I invited you to Washington
with pure intentions,

674
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,868
so that we could break bread
and learn to trust one another.

675
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,995
Francis, I don't get softened up

676
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,040
by a nice dinner
and dancing with a beautiful woman.

677
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,335
You asked me what I want.

678
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:59,504
Well... I told you.

679
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:02,841
[laughs]

680
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:04,384
I'll tell you what.

681
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,094
It's my turn to get some sleep.

682
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,721
Let's attack all this with a fresh mind.

683
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:10,432
We've barely smoked our cigars.

684
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,770
We're not men of excess, though, are we?

685
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:17,856
Aren't we?

686
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:23,403
No, no.

687
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:25,154
No, you're right.

688
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:30,159
Enough smoke for one evening.

689
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:46,635
[Claire] What are you going to do?

690
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,888
I don't know.

691
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,848
Try to meet him halfway.

692
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,895
Cathy and I were talking.

693
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:59,314
Maybe the Israelis
and the Palestinians are right.

694
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,566
We should consider starting with them.

695
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,152
Use the United Nations
to put pressure on Russia.

696
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:07,656
- How?
- Uniting for Peace.

697
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,409
General Assembly overrides
a Russian veto in the Security Council.

698
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:15,622
Well, that'll just antagonize them
even if it works. And it won't.

699
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,458
Well, it might work.
Cathy seems to think it could.

700
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,294
I thought you believed in this plan.

701
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:24,756
We were just...
brainstorming alternatives.

702
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,717
Well, I've worked too hard on it
just to abandon it.

703
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:31,387
Okay, you know best.

704
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:55,119
[Claire] Do you mind?

705
00:42:56,913 --> 00:42:58,331
What?

706
00:42:58,414 --> 00:42:59,666
[Claire] The light.

707
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,805
Francis.

708
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:17,559
He's a thug.

709
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:19,477
Smart, but he's still a thug.

710
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:21,270
Don't cower to him.

711
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:35,368
Where I come from, we drop a raw egg
into some tomato juice and drink that.

712
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:37,328
Luckily, I don't come from there.

713
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:38,914
[Seth chuckles lightly]

714
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:42,333
That's a perfect job for Doug.
I can't imagine why he'd turn it down.

715
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,210
He thinks we were behind it.

716
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:46,755
I told him we weren't,
but I don't think he believes me.

717
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:48,715
Said he doesn't need training wheels.

718
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:51,676
Well, I want you to still stop in
from time to time and see him.

719
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,802
Yes, sir.

720
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:56,681
Is the Secretary of Defense here?
Send him in.

721
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,143
- [man] Mr. President.
- We don't have much time.

722
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:03,813
Petrov gets here in 90 minutes.
We need to talk Europe.

723
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,691
The answer is yes.

724
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:54,154
- To some, not all, of what you asked.
- I see.

725
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,658
I'm prepared
to scale back significantly.

726
00:44:56,741 --> 00:45:01,287
Now, I have to speak to my team first
and my allies in NATO,

727
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,706
but I'm confident that we can
do something meaningful

728
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,959
in Poland and the Czech Republic.

729
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:08,419
Now, our people
can work out the specifics.

730
00:45:08,503 --> 00:45:13,424
And whatever it is we decide
and agree on, the public cannot know.

731
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:21,390
I woke up with the taste
of those cigars in my mouth.

732
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,185
Thinking of Cuba and Kennedy.

733
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,815
I won't be humiliated
the way Khrushchev was with Turkey.

734
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:32,944
Well, you can't possibly compare what
I'm proposing to what happened then.

735
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:36,031
I can only consider a partial
scale-back if you announce it.

736
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,077
This press conference
is about the Jordan Valley.

737
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:44,122
The most important thing about the
missiles is the scale-back, not the PR.

738
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:46,541
My people would know
I walked away with something.

739
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:51,129
And, by announcing it,
I can keep you to your word.

740
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:53,923
I am more than
meeting you halfway, Viktor.

741
00:45:56,634 --> 00:45:58,260
[sighs]

742
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:04,308
You know what the best part
of the fall of the Soviet Union was?

743
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:06,895
The cars.

744
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:10,648
Have you ever been in, um... a Lada?

745
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:12,232
Lada? No, I haven't.

746
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:15,070
No? Oh. It's the worst car ever built.

747
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:16,738
Tiny, little thing, you know.

748
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:20,240
Your head would hit the ceiling
when you hit a pothole.

749
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:23,452
And the heat never worked.
[chuckles]

750
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:25,038
And no air conditioning.

751
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:28,124
You know, your skin would stick
to the seats in the summer.

752
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,001
It was a coffin on wheels.

753
00:46:30,085 --> 00:46:34,589
But then, after the fall,
we got the Lexus.

754
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:39,177
Temperature control.
Automatic windows.

755
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:41,137
And so much room.

756
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:44,224
First time I fucked my ex-wife,
in a Lexus.

757
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,308
- [laughs]
- You could never do that in a Lada.

758
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,853
No space. Huh? [laughs]

759
00:46:48,937 --> 00:46:51,814
You see, Mr. President.

760
00:46:51,898 --> 00:46:53,649
I want the Lexus.

761
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,112
And you're trying to sell me a Lada.

762
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:25,807
I'll have them bring
your motorcade around.

763
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:31,187
But the... press conference.

764
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,733
Oh. Right!

765
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:37,819
I'd completely forgotten.

766
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,572
But I think we're gonna be okay
without one today.

767
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:45,743
Have a safe journey home,
Mr. President.

768
00:47:55,128 --> 00:47:57,797
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. President.

769
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:10,226
Give me the Secretary of State.

770
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:27,367
The president will be speaking alone.
No joint conference.

771
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,662
[all clamoring]

772
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:31,831
The president will be out shortly.

773
00:48:31,914 --> 00:48:34,000
[all clamoring]

774
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:40,882
[Frank] Last night,
I had the pleasure of hosting

775
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,885
some very special guests
here at the White House.

776
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:46,888
True Russian patriots
who exhibit the very best

777
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:49,265
that their country has to offer.

778
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:52,227
Their names: Nadya Tolokonnikova,

779
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,646
Masha Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov.

780
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,234
As you're all aware,
they stood up to President Petrov,

781
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:03,779
and forced him to listen to the truths
that he didn't want to hear.

782
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,910
And, well, that had
a profound effect on me.

783
00:49:08,993 --> 00:49:12,080
Because it made me realize
that I need to stand up to him as well.

784
00:49:12,163 --> 00:49:14,332
As does our country.

785
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:18,669
When I invited the president here,
I set out hoping to find a partner.

786
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:21,214
But the demands
that President Petrov made

787
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:26,177
proves to me that peace
is not a priority for him.

788
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:29,764
Peace should not have to be bought.

789
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:32,641
Peace should be its own reward,

790
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:36,312
and we will achieve it,
with or without him.

791
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:38,398
- Thank you very much.
- [reporters clamoring]

792
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,691
You have thoughts
on how to bypass Russia.

793
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:44,279
The idea is to negate Russia's
veto in the Security Council.

794
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:47,489
I'll let the ambassador tell you
what we have in mind.

795
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:49,825
[Claire begins indistinctly]

796
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:58,084
[rock music plays]

797
00:52:00,438 --> 00:52:04,913
